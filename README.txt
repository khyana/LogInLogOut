Analysis
----------------------------

1) Issues and/or challenges you’ve come across and how did you overcome them?

Unable to find the loginLink object as the page load was taking time.So included implicit wait.
2)If you had more time what would you do differently?
-I would have implemented explicit wait with condition.
-If permitted with enough time, I would have implemented excel file integration to avoid hardcoded username and password.
3) What other test cases would you automate and why?
Test case 1: invalid Username and Valid Password
	Invalid Username and Invalid Password
	Valid Username and Invalid password

4) What dependencies or 3rd party frameworks/libs/modules used and why?
TestNG - to make programme more granulated and readable.
